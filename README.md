# Microservice Spring Cloud

This application is an example of how to create an application using Microservice Architecture with Spring Cloud.

In this example I established communication between microservices, enable load balancing, scaling up and down of microservices.
I also centralize configuration of microservices with Spring Cloud Config Server. 
Eureka Naming Server and Distributed tracing with Spring Cloud Sleuth and Zipkin implementation were also built in this project.
In this project there is some examples of how to implement fault tolerance microservices with Zipkin.

This example was built while I was doing https://www.udemy.com/course/microservices-with-spring-boot-and-spring-cloud
